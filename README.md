# Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Overview

This arcade game project is developed as a part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree][1] program, with visual assets and a game loop engine provided in the course.

This is a JavaScript arcade game, inspired by the classic arcade game called 'Frogger'.

## How to get started

Play the game [here][2].

## Objective

Move the player with the arrow keys to collect gems. Each of the gems gives you some points. You should gain 500 points to win the game.

## Instructions

- Press the space bar to start a new game.
- The player starts out with 4 lives.

- Collect gems to gain points.
  - Orange gem: 50 points.
  - Blue gem: 20 points.
  - Green gem: 10 points.
- You win the game once you get 500 points.
- You lose the game if you lose all your lives.
